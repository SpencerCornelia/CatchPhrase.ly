CatchPhrase.ly
Let's build an app for our favorite game Catchphrase!

This lab will span over the course of several days. The suggested workflow for each day is outlined below. We will wrap up our work on 5/18.

Day 3 / Weekend

We will be building the last iteration of the CatchPrase.ly App!

Reference lessons: Mongo(ose) Intro & Express Implementation of Mongo

Getting Started

Make sure you can successfully connect to your DB & run CRUD commands from the Node REPL / console. Please test this beforehand.

Submission

Submit a link to the catchphrase repo on your GitHub account.

User Stories

Goal: Users can see the same phrases in the application, even if the server restarts. (The phrase data is persistent.)

Users should be able to see existing phrases (served from the DB)
Users should be able to save new phrases (permanently to the DB)
Users should be able to delete specific phrases (from the DB)
Bonus: Users should be able to edit & save (update) catchphrases that are already in the DB.
